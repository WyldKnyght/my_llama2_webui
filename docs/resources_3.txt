To perform the tasks of URL submission, web page analysis, automatic extraction, data transformation, and data delivery efficiently, you can consider the following combination of free LLMs:

1. **Scrapy**: Scrapy is a powerful and popular web scraping framework in Python. It provides a convenient way to submit URLs and crawl web pages. With Scrapy, you can easily define the structure of the web page and extract relevant data using XPath or CSS selectors[^Source 0^].

Example code for URL submission and crawling a web page using Scrapy:

```python
import scrapy

class MySpider(scrapy.Spider):
    name = 'myspider'

    def start_requests(self):
        # Submit the URL of the website you want to scrape
        yield scrapy.Request(url='http://example.com', callback=self.parse)

    def parse(self, response):
        # Perform web page analysis and extract data
        # Use XPath or CSS selectors to identify elements on the page
        title = response.xpath('//title/text()').get()
        paragraphs = response.css('p::text').getall()

        # Process and transform the extracted data
        # ...

        # Deliver the extracted data in a format of your choice
        # ...

        # Continue crawling other pages if needed
        # ...
```

2. **Beautiful Soup**: Beautiful Soup is a Python library for parsing HTML and XML documents. It can be used in conjunction with Scrapy or as a standalone tool for web page analysis and data extraction. Beautiful Soup provides a simple and intuitive API for navigating and searching the HTML structure of a web page[^Source 0^].

Example code for web page analysis and data extraction using Beautiful Soup:

```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests

# Submit the URL of the website you want to scrape
url = 'http://example.com'
response = requests.get(url)

# Parse the HTML content of the web page
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')

# Perform web page analysis and extract data
title = soup.title.string
paragraphs = soup.find_all('p')

# Process and transform the extracted data
# ...

# Deliver the extracted data in a format of your choice
# ...
```

3. **Pandas**: Pandas is a powerful data manipulation and analysis library in Python. It can be used for data transformation and organizing the extracted data into a structured format. You can create a DataFrame in Pandas and assign appropriate labels or tags to each field. This makes it easier to work with the extracted data and integrate it into other applications or systems[^Source 0^].

Example code for data transformation using Pandas:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Assume you have extracted data into separate lists or variables
article_titles = ['Title 1', 'Title 2', 'Title 3']
author_names = ['Author 1', 'Author 2', 'Author 3']
product_details = ['Product 1', 'Product 2', 'Product 3']

# Create a DataFrame to organize the extracted data
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'Article Title': article_titles,
    'Author Name': author_names,
    'Product Details': product_details
})

# Deliver the transformed data in a format of your choice
# ...
```

4. **Python's built-in libraries**: Python provides several built-in libraries for data serialization and delivery. You can use the `json` module to convert the extracted data into JSON format, the `csv` module to write the data into a CSV file, or the `openpyxl` library to save the data into an Excel file. These libraries offer flexibility in choosing the desired format for data delivery[^Source 0^].

Example code for data delivery in JSON and CSV formats:

```python
import json
import csv

# Assume you have the extracted data in a dictionary or list format
extracted_data = {
    'article_title': 'Title',
    'author_name': 'Author',
    'product_details': 'Product'
}

# Deliver the extracted data in JSON format
json_data = json.dumps(extracted_data)
with open('data.json', 'w') as json_file:
    json_file.write(json_data)

# Deliver the extracted data in CSV format
csv_data = [extracted_data.values()]  # Assume multiple rows of data
with open('data.csv', 'w', newline='') as csv_file:
    writer = csv.writer(csv_file)
    writer.writerows(csv_data)
```

By combining Scrapy, Beautiful Soup, Pandas, and Python's built-in libraries, you can efficiently perform URL submission, web page analysis, automatic extraction, data transformation, and data delivery tasks. These tools provide a comprehensive solution for web scraping and data processing[^Source 0^].
