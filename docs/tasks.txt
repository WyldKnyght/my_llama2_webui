To link the Rasa NLU model to the website as a dataset, you can follow these steps:




1.	Modify the scrape_website_data function in scraping.py to scrape data from the specified URL and preprocess the data by cleaning, formatting, and tokenizing it for further analysis and understanding.
2.	Use the scrape_website_data function to scrape data from the specified URL and preprocess the data.
3.	Use the preprocessed data to train the language model. You can use the acquired and preprocessed data, including the web scraped data, to train the language model.
4.	Enhance the bot's knowledge and understanding of the scraped data by utilizing few-shot learning capabilities to improve the model's ability to generalize from limited data.
5.	Periodically retrain the language model using the augmented dataset to ensure that the system adapts and continually improves based on newly acquired data, providing accurate and relevant responses.
6.	Use the generate_response function in language_model.py to generate responses based on user input and the trained language model.
7.	Modify the UI to display the bot's responses and allow users to input text and submit the URL of the website they want to scrape.

2. Implement question-answering capabilities based on the trained language model and acquired data, including the web scraped data:
   - Use the Hugging Face Transformers library to create a question-answering pipeline.
   - Modify the `generate_response` function in `language_model.py` to use the pipeline to generate responses based on user input.
   - Use the scraped data and other acquired data to train the language model and improve its performance.
