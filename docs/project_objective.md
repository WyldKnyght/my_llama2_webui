# Project Objective: 
Create a Self-Improving AI Web Scraping Assistant bot that automates dataset creation by web scraping using free open-source resources.

# AI Chatbot UI Development:
## Create an AI Chatbot User Interface with the following features:
- Conversational capabilities for interacting with users.
- Implement question-answering capabilities based on the trained language model and acquired data, including the web scraped data.
- Internet connectivity for web scraping and accessing external data.
- Ask users for clarification and additional information.
- Incorporation of advanced language models for improved understanding and responses.
- URL Submission, implement a feature for users to submit the URL of the website they want to scrape through the UI.

# Auto Web Scraping:
- Utilize web scraping libraries to crawl web pages' HTML structure and content.
- Identify and extract relevant data.

# Data Preprocessing:
- Preprocess the extracted data by cleaning, formatting, and tokenizing it for further analysis and understanding.

# Language Model Integration:
- Use the acquired and preprocessed data, including the web scraped data, to train the language model.
- Enhance the bot's knowledge and understanding of the scraped data.
- Utilize few-shot learning capabilities to improve the model's ability to generalize from limited data.
- Include training with the latest AI, LLM, and NLP research to stay updated with advancements.
- Explore multimodal models for a more comprehensive understanding.

# Language Model Learning and Training: 
- Combining Extracted Data: When training the language model, merge the data acquired through web scraping with the previously obtained data from other sources.
- This combination results in a more diverse and comprehensive training dataset for the bot.
- Implement active learning techniques to select and acquire additional training data that addresses the system's weaknesses.
- Incorporate reinforcement learning techniques to optimize the system's performance.
- Enable the model to learn from rewards or penalties, continually improving its responses over time.
- Implement, periodically retrain the language model using the augmented dataset.
- Implement user feedback function to ensure that the system adapts and continually improves based on newly acquired data, providing accurate and relevant responses.

Leverage the most effective Python libraries and frameworks, or a combination of, for the tasks, including BeautifulSoup, Selenium, Scrapy, Pandas, Python's built-in libraries, LangChain, EmbedChain, Rasa, TensorFlow, TensorFlow Hub, NumPy, Hugging Face Transformers, OpenDialog, BotMan, and ChatterBot.
